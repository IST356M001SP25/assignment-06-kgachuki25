Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

In this assignment, I learned how to use APIs and data transformations to create a data pipeline. The greatest challenge I had was with the 
data transformations, and trying to process the json coming from the APIs. Figuring out how the json data was layed out was a challenge, so I 
output them in streamlit to confirm I understood the data. I also tried out the API functions on the CENT API website so I could better 
understand how to handle the data. One thing that came up later was the failed test results, where the number of lines in the csv did not 
match the expected. It seems like certain reviews that appear in the solution csv files were not appearing for me when doing the review 
extraction. When I addressed the number of lines expected from the test, all other parts were able to pass. Overall, I was able to work out 
most of the bigger issues and get the output.
