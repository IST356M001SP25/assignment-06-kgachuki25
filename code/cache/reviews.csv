The waitress was amazing, happy, and so encouraging with my mother in law, considering it was her first time having Vietnamese food. We enjoyed and ate all of it! And it was a lot! So good, in fact, I put the bowl up to my mouth, lol! So worth it!!!"

The prices are a bit high, but portions are big and for a single individual could make several meals, so overall good rating. I ordered vegan fried rice and vegan mei fun, both are excellent! I would recommend!"

We have been to this restaurant couple of times and didn‚Äôt disappoint us. Taking from food to service is fast and better than another similar restaurants around Syracuse.

Food is delicious (mild) and well cooked. They have many dishes that comes with your choice of meat chicken beef vegetarian and vegan as well. Just let you clarify the portion is great - like really good enough for one person, prices are decent and big menu.

Went there with family first time and ordered many dishes, all of them were wonderful and came with extra sauces. Meet Danny there very interesting guy from Vietnam and knows a lot about it üòá, very professional and knowledgeable about the food and sarcastic.

Highly recommend this place and must try all dishes üòáüòÅ"

After the appointment I needed something mild for my stomach. I found this place on Google, stopped in to check out the menu, and ordered some Chicken Pho. It was super tasty and available as gluten free. The woman who waited on my was very nice and checked in on me several times, which I appreciated very much. The bonus was some vintage music playing which seemed very relaxing to me after a stressful morning and mid-day. THANK YOU!"

The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Ordered the spring rolls and pho.  It was prepared quickly and tasted delicious. I only gave 4 stars on the food since some of the noodles were clumped together but overall taste was good. Note that the price is higher when paying with credit card. This is noted very clearly on the menu. Also they added a 15% tip. I will Vito again and recommend."

7,ChIJXzHY70ny2YkRMytGWVnP-I0,New Century,John Elmer,5,I love this place. The food is great and it‚Äôs a simple ma and pa place. The pho is outstanding! ( if you‚Äôre really hungry you can get extra noodles for $1) I always get the spring rolls because they are super fresh. The raw beef w tumerum is excellent. We got the fish today ( see pic) and it was tasty.

9,ChIJXzHY70ny2YkRMytGWVnP-I0,New Century,Andy Zheng,5,"I got the Bun Bi Cha Gio Nem and I love the fried egg roll and meatballs. Maybe the egg rolls had taro inside which made it taste better ü§∑. I forgot how long it took me to get my food, but it wasn‚Äôt long and the waiters always smiled when there was eye contact üòÇ. 15% gratitude is included in the bill and paying with cash cost less. That‚Äôs my experience. I‚Äôm coming back for pho."
